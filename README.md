# Breakout
Getting into the basics of Unity with a short and sweet learning project.
Idea comes from the classic Atari Game.

# Project Notes:
 - All pixel art is scaled up by 15x15
 - Files are sorted, animations are in 'animations', sheets are in 'sprite sheets', etc.
 - I have no idea what I'm doing

# TODO:
 - write collision script for block (when it collides with ball, play 'break' animation and then delete/hide)
 - write script for block that makes it play 'shine animation' once every 5 or so seconds
 - create prefabs for block (multiple prefabs of different colors)
 - do art for paddle
 - write movement script for ball (with bouncing off walls and blocks)
 - write playerController for paddle
 - add a losing/restart mechanic
 - title screen
 - game over (win/lose) screen


# EXTRA CREDIT 
(Stuff that we can try after we finish the base game):

 - Sound engine
 - scorekeeper - some colors could be more valuable than others
 - Particle effects
    - give the ball a trailing effect
    - add particles to breaking animation
    - particles for when the ball hits the paddle
 - Combos
    - Computer records how many blocks you are able to hit before the ball returns to the paddle
 - Power-ups
    - could slow ball down for easier paddling
    - make paddle wider
    - allows player to place a block anywhere on the screen with mouse(that cannot be destroyed) (is temporary)
    - allows player to aim their next hit using mouse
 - Some kind of startup animation?
   - Reveals all blocks one by one in a little animation (maybe even reverse the breaking animation)
